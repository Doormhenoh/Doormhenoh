# Hi there, I'm Dominic

Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional | Pursuing CompTIA Security+ and ISC2CC
<br/>Building hands-on projects that simulate real-world attack and defense scenarios  
<br/>Sharing my learning journey and practical projects here on GitHub  


## Current Focus
- Preparing for security certifications(ISC2 and CompTIA Security+)
- Developing integrated projects that combine:
  - VirtualBox for lab virtualization
  - Kali Linux for offensive security testing
  - Burp Suite for web application testing
  - Windows Server for enterprise defense and monitoring

## Certifications
- ISC2CC

## Featured Projects
Here are some of the projects I’m working on that bring all these tools together:

- Vulnerability Assessment & Exploitation Lab 
  Simulated a penetration test from start to finish: scanning with Nmap, exploiting Metasploitable, testing web apps with Burp Suite, and monitoring defenses on Windows Server.  

- Red vs. Blue Team Simulation
  Offensive attacks launched from Kali and Burp Suite against Metasploitable, while Windows Server was configured to detect and log suspicious activity. Documented both attack and defense perspectives.  

- Web Application Security Testing
  Intercepted and tested vulnerable web apps (DVWA) with Burp Suite, automated attacks with Kali tools, and compared results against a hardened Windows Server IIS setup.  

- Active Directory Attack & Defense
  Built a Windows Server AD domain, simulated attacks from Kali (password spraying, SMB exploitation), and documented detection and hardening strategies.  

- Incident Response Case Study
  Launched a controlled attack, collected logs from Windows Server, and wrote an incident report with timeline, evidence, and remediation steps.
